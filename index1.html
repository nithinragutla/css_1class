      <p>Quite a long time ago, there lived two talking birds with their parents. One day when their parents were away, a villager who generally had an eye on those special birds caught them and took them away. One of the birds got away from the trap and looked for his parents. The bird, at last, arrived at a hermitage where it was welcomed and had some food. He lived joyfully.
          An explorer once ran over the other bird that the villager caught. He talked very rudely to him. He was shocked to see a talking bird but at the same time was angry with his way of behaving. The explorer visited the hermitage and recognised a similar talking bird, yet this bird talked respectfully and welcomed him to remain there.<pre></pre>
          <b>Moral of the Story:</b>
          Staying in a good company gives us a good way of behaving. Bad company influences our way of behaving negatively.</p>

          <p>One day, a hare was showing off how fast he could run. He laughed at the turtle for being so slow. After seeing the overconfidence, the turtle moved him to a race. The hare (rabbit) laughed at the turtle's test, and he accepted his demand.
              As the race began, the rabbit ran extremely quickly and went far ahead of the turtle and got drained. He thought there was a lot of time to relax as the turtle was far away. Soon he slept, thinking he would win the race easily.
              However, the turtle(tortoise) kept walking slowly until he arrived at the finish line. The rabbit sees the turtle on the opposite side of the finish line. The turtle had won the race.<pre></pre>
              <b>Moral of the Story:</b>
              Slow and consistent wins the race.</p>

          <p>After a shipwreck, a man who was the last standing figured out how to arrive at the shore. He asked God for help. After waiting too long for God to answer his requests, he built himself a hut for his protection with destroyed bits of a shipwreck.
            Every day he invested a lot of energy searching for food and looking at the skyline for God's help. One day, when he returned from his food search, he found his little hut burnt to ashes. Losing all hope, he felt helpless and shouted out of anger, "Why God? Why do you never answer my prayers?"
              After a couple of hours, a boat arrived at the shore for his rescue. The man asked the captain of the ship, "How could you track me down?" The Captain of the ship answered, "We saw your smoke signal for help.The man's faith in God's will was re-established.<pre></pre>
              <b>Moral of Story:</b>
              Don't lose faith since bad things are occurring to you. God has his own particular manner of working.</p>

              <p>There was once a pleased elephant who generally harassed smaller animals. He would go to the ant colony and shower water on the ants. The ants, with their size, could just cry. The elephant laughed and threatened the ants that he would kill them.
                 The ants had enough and chose to show the elephant a lesson.They went straight into the elephant's trunk and started messing with him. The elephant started crying in pain. He understood his mistake and apologised to the ants and every one of the animals he had harassed.<pre></pre>
                <b>Moral of Story:</b>
                  Be humble and treat everybody with respect. If you think you are stronger than others, then use your solidarity to safeguard them instead of hurting them.</p>
